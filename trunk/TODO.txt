- Add URL key support to perf analysis
- Add possibility to provide perf summary that includes average, max, cumulated times for pages
- In Jahia, add sessionID output and support in the log analyzer for this output.
- Documentation with screenshots and maybe even a small movie to illustrate how to use
- Add code that, if we change the directory of one of the output files, ask if we want to do the same for all output files.
- Look into possibility to detect in which subsystem a thread is (Lucene, etc...), could we do this through stack analysis ? What about global Jahia actions ?
- Add support for parsing /site/ in URL
