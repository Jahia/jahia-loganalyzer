
TODO 

This is a quick and dirty laundry list of ideas and improvements for future 
version of the Jahia Log Analysis tool :

- In Jahia, add sessionID output and support in the log analyzer for this output.
- Documentation with screenshots and maybe even a small movie to illustrate how to use
- Look into possibility to detect in which subsystem a thread is (Lucene, 
  etc...), could we do this through stack analysis ? What about global Jahia actions ?
- Add support for parsing /site/ in URL
